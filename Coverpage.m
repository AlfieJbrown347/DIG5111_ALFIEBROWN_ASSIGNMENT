DIG5111 Coursework – Audio Signal Processing Project
Student Name: Alfie Brown
Student ID: 23151156
Module: DIG5111 – Digital Signal Processing

----------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------
This project includes three tasks where I worked with audio signals in MATLAB. 
Each task is explained with clear comments, and the scripts let the user 
interact with the filters and see how audio is affected.

TASK BREAKDOWN
----------------------------------------------------

Task 1 – Compare Audio Files
- Lets the user load two audio files
- Converts them to mono if needed
- Uses FFT to show their frequency content
- You can zoom into certain bands and play them back

Task 2 – Audio Filter Tool
- Loads any .wav file
- User chooses what type of filter to use (low-pass or high-pass)
- Selects filter type (Butterworth or Chebyshev), cutoff, and order
- Shows the result in both time and frequency plots
- Saves and plays back the output

Task 3 – Clean Noisy Signal
- Loads the provided noisy file (task1sig.wav)
- Applies a low-pass Butterworth filter to remove high-frequency noise
- Saves the result and lets you listen to before and after
